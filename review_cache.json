    "main.py": "Your code looks clean and straightforward. It follows good practices such as exception handling, proper logging, and readability. However, there are a few observations and suggestions for refinement:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Logging Enhancements**\n- **Unicode Characters in Log Messages**:\n  Unicode characters like `\ud83d\ude80` and `\ud83d\uded1` may not render properly in all environments or logging backends. Though they improve readability in local use, consider using simple text messages for broader compatibility in production environments.\n\n    ```python\n    logging.info(\"StealthTrader Auto-Trading System Starting...\")\n    ```\n\n- **Exception Details with Traceback**:\n  When logging exceptions, it's better to include the traceback for debugging purposes. This can be done using `exc_info=True`.\n\n    ```python\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.error(\"An error occurred\", exc_info=True)\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Handling API Key and Secret Errors**\n- You presume that `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` are correctly imported from the `config` module. However, if either of these keys is `None` or invalid, the program will likely fail during bot initialization without a clear explanation for the user.\n\n    Consider adding a check to validate `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` before proceeding:\n    ```python\n    if not API_KEY or not API_SECRET:\n        logging.error(\"Missing or invalid API credentials. Please check your configuration.\")\n        return\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Graceful Shutdown**\n- While the `KeyboardInterrupt` exception provides a way to stop the program, it's recommended to include any cleanup steps (if necessary) to gracefully shut down the system. For example, if the `TradingBot` class has resources like API connections or threads, ensure these are properly closed.\n\n    Example:\n    ```python\n    try:\n        while True:\n            bot.run_trading_cycle()\n            time.sleep(5)\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        logging.info(\"\ud83d\uded1 System Shutdown Requested by User.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logging.error(f\"\u274c Unexpected Error: {e}\", exc_info=True)\n    finally:\n        bot.cleanup()  # Call cleanup logic if necessary (ensure this method exists in TradingBot)\n        logging.info(\"Shutdown complete. Goodbye!\")\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Modular Design**\n- If you plan to expand this script in the future, consider breaking it into smaller reusable components. For instance, moving parts of `main()` to separate functions could enhance testing and maintenance.\n\n    Example:\n    ```python\n    def initialize_bot():\n        # Initialize and return the bot\n        return TradingBot(api_key=API_KEY, api_secret=API_SECRET)\n\n    def run_bot(bot):\n        try:\n            while True:\n                bot.run_trading_cycle()\n                time.sleep(5)\n        except KeyboardInterrupt:\n            logging.info(\"Shutdown requested by user.\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            logging.error(\"An error occurred\", exc_info=True)\n        finally:\n            bot.cleanup()\n    ```\n\n    The new `main()` function would then look like this:\n    ```python\n    def main():\n        logging.info(\"StealthTrader Auto-Trading System Starting...\")\n        bot = initialize_bot()\n        run_bot(bot)\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **5. Add Configuration Validation**\nIf the `TradingBot` depends on a configuration file, ensure that the values are sanitized/validated upon loading to avoid runtime errors. For instance:\n- Check if an API endpoint is configured correctly.\n- Ensure the appropriate trading pairs or market data feeds are set up.\n\nYou can optionally integrate a configuration validation step at initialization.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Add Unit Testability**\nEncourage better testing practices by designing your code with testability in mind. For example:\n- Allow dependency injection of `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET`.\n- Use mockable objects for testing `TradingBot`.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Use a Runtime Retry or Backoff Mechanism**\nIf `TradingBot.run_trading_cycle()` encounters intermittent errors (e.g., API failures), a small retry mechanism or exponential backoff could improve resiliency. For now, the program will log an error and continue, but retries could prevent missed trading opportunities.\n\n    Example:\n    ```python\n    import random\n    import time\n\n    def run_trading_cycle_with_retry(bot, max_attempts=3):\n        attempts = 0\n        while attempts < max_attempts:\n            try:\n                bot.run_trading_cycle()\n                return  # Exit if successful\n            except Exception as e:\n                attempts += 1\n                logging.error(f\"Cycle failed (attempt {attempts}/{max_attempts}): {e}\")\n                time.sleep(2 ** attempts)  # Exponential backoff\n        logging.error(\"Maximum retry attempts reached. Skipping trading cycle.\")\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **8. Type Annotations**\nAdding type annotations improves clarity and readability, especially for larger teams or projects.\n\n    Example:\n    ```python\n    from typing import NoReturn\n\n    def main() -> NoReturn:\n        logging.info(\"Starting StealthTrader Auto-Trading System...\")\n        bot: TradingBot = TradingBot(api_key=API_KEY, api_secret=API_SECRET)\n        try:\n            while True:\n                bot.run_trading_cycle()\n                time.sleep(5)\n        except KeyboardInterrupt:\n            logging.info(\"System shutdown requested by the user.\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            logging.error(f\"An error occurred: {e}\", exc_info=True)\n    ```\n\n---\n\n### **9. Dependencies**\nEnsure your `config` and `trading_bot` modules are well-documented and tested, as the functionality of this script is tightly coupled to them. For instance:\n- Clearly document how `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` are set.\n- Ensure `TradingBot` is resilient to invalid arguments or exceptions.\n\nConsider including a requirements file (`requirements.txt`) or instructions for the environment setup if it hasn't already been done.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\nYour code is well-written, clean, and functional for its purpose. However, for robustness, I recommend the following:\n1. Improve exception logging with `exc_info=True`.\n2. Validate the presence of API credentials.\n3. Introduce cleaner shutdown/cleanup logic.\n4. Make the script modular and testable.\n5. Consider adding retry/backoff mechanisms for resiliency.\n\nLet me know if you'd like further assistance!"
